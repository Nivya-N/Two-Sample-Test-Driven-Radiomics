# Two-Sample-Test-Driven-Radiomics

The work statistically analyses the brain MRI derived radiomics data.Five statistical tests are used to analyse the data.

**Key Features**
 

✅ Features of the work include rigorous analysis of the radiomic features extracted.   
✅Three distinct datasets were used for the detailed radiomic analysis in the study.   
✅ Novel approach of radiomic analysis

🔧 **Instructions to Run the Code**

✅Download datasets for Alzheimer's and Mild Cognitive Impairment from ADNI website (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/), and BraTS 2019 dataset from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/brain-tumor-egmentation-brats-2019).  
✅Use PyTorch platform and compatible Python version.  
✅Use Pyradiomics toolbox V3.1.0.  
✅Radiomics features are be extracted from each datasets.  
✅The radiomic data is stored as .csv files and this data is used for further processing.
